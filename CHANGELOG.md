## [1.2.4] — 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- `Invalid count value: -1` re-surfacing in certain environments — previous fix used `strip: 1` on the temp-dir extraction which still crashes when the tarball contains `pax_global_header` or other depth-0 special entries; replaced with `strip`-free extraction using an `onentry` callback to detect the actual root directory name at runtime, then pointing `copyMerge()` at `tmpDir/<rootDir>/.github/`

### Changed

- `copilot-kit status` — simplified to show only the installed package version and a version-check result; removed installation health and component checks; if a newer release exists, the output box shows the exact `npx @ntdev204/copilot-kit update` command to run
- Web copy: "Re-run init anytime" → "Run update anytime" in the Always Latest feature description

### Added

- `--version` / `-v` flag — prints the installed package version (`PKG_VERSION`) and exits; available after both `npx` invocation and global install (`copilot-kit --version`)
- `help` output now includes a **Flags** section documenting `--version` and `-v`, and shows the `copilot-kit <command>` usage line for global installs
- Web: per-card icon colors on the homepage feature grid (violet · blue · red · cyan · emerald · amber) and the docs landing page section cards (amber · blue · violet)

## [1.2.3] — 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- `Invalid count value: -1` error thrown by node-tar v7 — root cause: `strip: 1` runs before `filter`, so the shallow root-directory entry in the tarball (`ntdev204-copilot-kit-<hash>/`) caused an invalid depth calculation before the filter could reject it
- Stray `ntdev204-copilot-kit-<hash>/` folder being created in the user's working directory — same root cause as above
- Merge mode (`init` on an existing `.github/`) still overwriting files — `keep` option in node-tar applies only within-archive, not to files already on disk

### Changed

- `src/scaffold.js` — extraction strategy replaced: tarball is now extracted in full to a temp directory (`os.tmpdir()`) using `strip: 1`; then a new `copyMerge()` helper copies only the `.github/` subtree into `cwd`, skipping existing files when `keepExisting = true`; temp directory is always cleaned up in `finally`
- `src/store.js` — removed `readLocalSha`, `writeLocalSha`, `fetchLatestSha`; replaced with `fetchLatestVersion()` which hits the GitHub Releases API (`/releases/latest`) and returns `tag_name` as a plain semver string (leading `v` stripped)
- `src/constants.js` — removed `SHA_FILE` and `COMMITS_URL` constants
- `copilot-kit update` and `copilot-kit status` — version comparison now uses `PKG_VERSION` (from `package.json`) as the installed version against the remote release tag; displays `v1.x.x` instead of a truncated commit SHA

### Removed

- `.github/.copilot-kit-sha` file — no longer written or read; version tracking is fully derived from the installed npm package version

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-03-02

### Changed

- `copilot-kit init` no longer prompts to delete `.github/` when it already exists — the command now **merges** instead: existing files are preserved and only missing files are written
- `downloadAndExtract()` in `src/scaffold.js` accepts a new `keepExisting` parameter (default `false`) and forwards it as `keep: keepExisting` to `tar.x`, relying on `node-tar`'s built-in skip-on-collision behaviour
- Section heading switches from **"What was created"** to **"What was merged"** when an existing `.github/` is detected
- Success box message switches from **"✔ Scaffolded successfully!"** to **"✔ Merged successfully!"** and adds a note `"Existing files were preserved — only missing files added"` in the merge path

### Removed

- Interactive overwrite prompt (`y/N`) from `copilot-kit init` — replaced by automatic merge behaviour
- Unused imports `warn`, `fail`, `bold`, `D`, and `prompt` from `src/commands/init.js`

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-01

### Added

- `copilot-kit update` command — checks local SHA against `ntdev204/copilot-kit@main`, shows a diff, prompts the user before overwriting `.github/`
- `copilot-kit status` command — shows installation health, lists all components with item counts, compares local vs. remote SHA and surfaces an update banner when behind
- Animated spinner (10-frame Braille) during download/extract operations
- ASCII art banner rendered in an ANSI box on every command invocation
- Coloured section headers (`▸ Preflight`, `▸ Downloading`, …) with per-section accent colours
- Boxed success / warning / error verdict at the end of each command
- `✔ / ℹ / ⚠ / ✖` log-level prefixes with distinct colours across all output lines
- SHA tracking — after every `init` / `update` a `.github/.copilot-kit-sha` file is written so future `update` and `status` calls can compare against the remote HEAD

### Changed

- CLI source refactored from a single `bin/cli.js` (640 lines) into focused modules under `src/`:
  - `src/constants.js` — shared constants; `PKG_VERSION` now read dynamically from `package.json`
  - `src/ui.js` — ANSI palette, `box()`, `section()`, log helpers, spinner, banner
  - `src/net.js` — `fetchTarball()`, `fetchJSON()`
  - `src/store.js` — `readLocalSha()`, `writeLocalSha()`, `fetchLatestSha()`
  - `src/prompt.js` — `prompt()`
  - `src/scaffold.js` — shared `downloadAndExtract()` used by both `init` and `update`
  - `src/commands/{init,update,status,help}.js` — one file per command
  - `bin/cli.js` reduced to a 22-line dispatch shim
- `PKG_VERSION` is no longer hard-coded — it is read from `package.json` at runtime
- Help screen now lists all three commands in a padded table with colour-coded names and one-line descriptions, including usage examples for each
- `package.json` `files` field updated to include `src/`

### Fixed

- `update` no longer silently overwrites without user confirmation; it now requires explicit `y` approval after showing the old → new SHA diff

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-03-01

### Added

- `npx @ntdev204/copilot-kit init` command — downloads and extracts `.github/` from the `main` branch of `ntdev204/copilot-kit` into the user's project
- Interactive overwrite prompt (`y/N`) when `.github/` already exists in the target directory
- Runtime tarball download via built-in `https` + `zlib` + `tar` — no bundling of `.github/` content in the npm package
- Automatic HTTPS redirect-following (up to 5 hops) to handle GitHub API → CDN redirects
- Clear success output listing all created directories after extraction
- Usage help printed when the CLI is invoked with no arguments or an unknown command
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — **Adaptive Governance Framework (AGF) v1.0** with 5-layer AI governance (Meta Principles → Risk Engine → Strictness Mode → Conflict Resolution → Validation Feedback Loop)
- 40+ domain skill files under `.github/skills/` (clean-code, frontend-design, api-patterns, systematic-debugging, ai-engineering, database-design, testing-patterns, and more)
- 11 governance rule files under `.github/rules/` (identity, task classification, consulting/build/debug/optimize modes, technical standards, communication, checklist, special situations, conflict resolution)
- 8 reusable prompt templates under `.github/prompts/` (fix-error, generate-tests, refactor, code-review, explain, optimize, document, new-skill)
- Agent mode definitions under `.github/agent/` (brainstorm, create, debug, deploy, enhance, orchestrate, plan, preview, test, ui-ux-pro-max)
- Validation & automation scripts under `.github/scripts/` (checklist, verify_all, session_manager, auto_preview)
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `CODEBASE.md` reference documents

### Security

- CLI writes only to `.github/` relative to `process.cwd()` — no path traversal possible
- All downloads over HTTPS from `api.github.com`
- No credentials or secrets are read, stored, or transmitted
- Upgraded from `tar@6.x` (known vulnerability) to `tar@7.x` (0 vulnerabilities at release)
